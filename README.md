Hi Welcome to my repository!

In this repositery I have connected the MySQL (phpMyAdmin) database to Flutter(Dart), THE MOST EASIEST WAY!

Two things I have done in this project:
1) Connected my Flutter app to SQL database.
2) Saving data into the database.

Pre-requisites:
1) vscode/android studio
2) flutter/dart and php setup
3) xampp

How to Run?
There are few steps you can follow to run this application successfully.
1) copy the "serverside" folder and paste it in 'htdocs' folder inside the xampp.
2) Run the Xampp.
3) now open the phpMyAdmin using your ip-address and create a database: database name: mydatabase, database table: tablename, columns: 'name' & 'age'.
4) open fluttermysql folder in vscode, open main.dart: enter your ip-address in line#37.
5) Everything is perfect. Enter data into two fields and click 'save' button. your data will be saved to phpMyAdmin.
